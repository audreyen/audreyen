    "text": "Every winter, the Wailuku River swells, the result of tropical storm after tropical storm tracking their way along the pacific jetstream, before eventually finding landfall on the Hawaiian islands. It was almost a ritual of sorts for families like mine living in Hilo to visit Rainbow Falls, a major waterfall and confluence of the Wailuku river tributaries. It was only when the water was raging and surging during these storms that the Boiling Pots were visible, a unique section of river where underwater currents and eroded volcanic rock made it seem as if the water itself was roiling and alive. The steam from Rainbow Falls just above it only added to the illusion. This phenomenon drew the attention of local families, farmers, and tourists alike, who all could appreciate the ecological and visual display. Water is a critical pillar of our past, present and future ecosystems, and its ability to bring people together and divide them is like no other. Hawaii is an island of abundance, and that is what I grew up surrounded by. My realization of this fact- and of scarcity of fresh water in our current day- happened at a pivotal moment in my academic and personal life. At the age of 17 I moved to Colorado to study Ecosystem Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University, with a subsequent focus on Water Resources and GIS. The contrast of everything I knew could not have been more clear and represented in this sudden shift of my environment. This momentous change allowed for my growing passion for sustainability, collaboration, and water resources management to develop over the following four years. As a land grant institution with significant roots in agriculture and water research, there were numerous avenues for exploration at CSU into ecosystem dynamics, hydrology, remote sensing, and the idea that there was potential for social sciences and technical sciences to provide direct benefit to communities and society at large. As our systems and biogeochemical processes continue to shift out of equilibrium, we know and see that these impacts are not felt equally on humans. Throughout my career, I hope to illustrate and address discrepancies and inequities across populations related to our water scarcity crisis, and provide critical information to support water resource decision making on a state level.\nBackground\nSimilar to many other students and professionals, I never had a specific “aha” moment regarding my pursuit into water resources. It felt more so a slow, steady, and informed gradient that was the product of my dedication to my education, my future, and my community. I grew up a chronic volunteer- I was always at some ranch, beach clean up, or advocacy group lending my time as a young child and teenager. When I began my studies at Colorado State University, I similarly sought out opportunities that would supplement my coursework and provide a greater understanding of the new state I had moved to. During my time as a teaching assistant for Stuart Cottrell, a tenured professor in the Ecotourism branch of the Human Dimensions of Natural Resources program, I applied my personal experiences with ecotourism from Hawaii to the planning, development, and implementation of several masters courses, including Protected Area and Decision Making, and Risk Management for Public Use. I assessed related literature and strategies for natural resource decision making, from which I emphasized communication and mediation tactics, benefits of mixed method data collection, and stakeholder engagement for the multimedia resources created from this endeavour. From this experience, I emerged with a newfound appreciation of the complexities of collaborative decision making, and of the research and data that is meticulously collected and analyzed to support those pursuits. In the summer following my sophomore year, I worked as a lab assistant and crew member for the Wheat Entomology Program, under the direction of Dr. Punya Nachappa and Adam Osterholzer. I found myself working long days in the blistering heat of Eastern Colorado, traipsing through wheat field after wheat field. These days allowed for extensive introspective, and cemented in my mind that I had grit; I could do hard things. This realization was twofold, as I realized that accomplishing difficult things was much easier with a team of diverse and dedicated individuals. The project I worked on investigated wheat line resistance to the Wheat Steam Sawfly pest in collaboration with the Agricultural Research, Development, and Education Center in partnership with the USDA. I spent many hours dissecting over 10,000 wheat stem samples and performing insect identification for over 1000 Wheat Stem Sawfly and endemic parasitoids, which aided our research in investigating trends in pest resistance and biological control across geographically separated populations. Following the hiring of several new lab assistants, I took initiative to help Adam with training and acclimating the new hires with the methodologies our lab took to ensure best practices were followed. I found a sense of pride in being a part of a team with real stakeholders and investment in a project that would provide knowledge, benefit, and connection to local farm communities.\nIntellectual Merit\nDuring my time working in this lab, I was simultaneously tackling some of the most challenging, yet rewarding courses in my academics. I built on a background in quantitative reasoning and ecosystem ecology to support my learning in a land use hydrology course, which challenged me to apply a conceptual understanding of biogeochemical cycles to hydrological models for estimating evaporation potential rates across varied landscapes, runoff potential in disturbed watersheds, and trends in hydrographs. I produced a comprehensive watershed assessment on the Dinwoody Creek Watershed, located in the Wind River mountain range of Wyoming. This project explored how geomorphological watershed characteristics impact precipitation, snow water equivalence, discharge, soil moisture, and potential evapotranspiration trends over time, and quantified variances and distribution patterns using linear regression models in R. Following this rather narrow dive into data analysis and data science, I sought balance in a Global Climate Justice course that explored on a broad scale how environmental controls and drivers create trajectories to climate justice issues among the world’s most vulnerable populations. I relished the scale of difference in studying a hyperspecific water quality parameter, yet being able to pull on my ecology and systems view to connect my observations to a larger socioecological picture that recognized anthropogenic influence and its inequities. I built up technical skills in computer languages such as R and Python that enabled me to automate geoprocessing tools and models, and more efficiently clean and parse data. I spent substantial time working in image processing softwares such as ENVI, as well as QGIS and ArcGIS Pro. I then had the opportunity to work with international stakeholders on a Sustainable Livelihoods, Conservation, and Climate Solutions project located in the Peruvian Andes. My team and I explored the feasibility of voluntary carbon offsets in a particular valley that has struggled with deforestation and overgrazing driving biodiversity and cultural loss, and anthropogenic driven changes to its hydrologic regime. We were able to use ENVI to model suitable areas for peatland and reforestation restoration projects using soil moisture indices, and ArcGIS Pro weighted overlay tools to finalize areas that could be used as a voluntary carbon market project in the region that would simultaneously combat the accelerated ecosystem degradation occurring.\nBroader Impacts\nEven as I briefly departed from water resources with this carbon offset project, I found myself drawn back once again. I took a water law, policy, and institutions course that rekindled the same spark I found in the climate justice course for my pursuit of meaning and purpose for my community, state, and world. I sought out an internship with the Colorado Division of Water Resources, where I conducted streamflow measurements using velocity meters (FlowTracker 2, Double A), and Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP RiverPro), and supported daily surface water administration by assisting water commissioners with chart runs and diversion, storage, and release records. I collaborated with numerous Surface Water Commissioners, Groundwater Commissioners, and Hydrographers to explore the current state of how water is put to beneficial use within the South Platter River Basin. This is a critical time for water users, water supply districts, and the Office of the State Engineer to engage in collaborative discussion surrounding the future of water scarcity within Colorado. I believe that there is much opportunity to utilize technology and frameworks for public deliberation that would ensure the proliferation of Colorado’s deep roots in agriculture, while allowing for municipal expansion, and for the reworking of watersheds back to a historically congruent flow regime."
