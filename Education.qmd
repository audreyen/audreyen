## Projects

1.  Sustainable Livelihoods, Biodiversity Conservation & Climate Solutions through Voluntary Carbon Offsets in the Peruvian Andes. Project Stakeholders: David LaGreca, Mountain Sentinels Alliance, Llupa Community, Instituto de Montaña. Project Members: Isabella Felsing, Audrey Engelhardt, Ally Lewis, Amelia Anderson

    1.  Synopsis: Healthy ecosystems in the alpine environments of Huascaran National Park, Peru are important for conserving biodiversity while having the potential to act as carbon sinks. Climate change & historical grazing patterns have degraded these ecosystems that instead might be contributing to carbon emissions. This project aimed to identify areas to reforest and restore peatlands as part of a voluntary carbon market project.

    2.  Deliverables: Quantify areas in Quilcayhuanca Valley suitable for Polylepis reforestation and peatland expansion/restoration and visualize findings for project stakeholders and project partners.
